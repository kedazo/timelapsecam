About:
 Whith this application you can make timelapse videos
 using your webcameras (or any v4l compatible device).

This project contains two subprojects:
 - a script which does the image capture and the video creation
 - a small GUI to make the configuration and start the video creation script

Debian packaging was made for Ubuntu GNU/Linux distributions.
